Design a modern and colorful “Our Services” section for a farming and agriculture labor website called Krishok Lagbe.
Use a green and yellow color palette inspired by nature and agriculture.
The section should have a clean, responsive layout with service cards showing different types of labor.

Include the following service cards with icons or illustrations:

Harvest Labour – Skilled workers for crop harvesting.

Plantation Labour – Helpers for planting and seedling setup.

Irrigation Team – Labour for water management and equipment setup.

Transport & Loading – Helpers for goods loading and unloading.

Land Preparation – Tractor drivers and land tilling support.

Maintenance Support – Ongoing crop care and maintenance workers.

Each card should include:

A relevant agriculture or labor icon (like 🌾🚜👨‍🌾💧)

A short description under each title

Rounded corners, soft shadows, and hover effects

Optional background gradient from #22c55e (green) to #facc15 (yellow)

Add a bold headline like “Our Services” at the top and a short subtitle:
“Connecting you with the right farm labour for every need.”
